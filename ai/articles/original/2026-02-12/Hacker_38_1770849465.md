My microwave oven started to malfunction at around five years old. It started to randomly power on the lamp, fan, and turntable. It progressively got worse over several weeks until it was mostly stuck on. The microwave oven is not usable when this happens: It behaves as if the door were open, causing the control panel to ignore button input and to stop cooking if it was cooking.

The obvious suspect is a failing door switch, which is a common cause of failure. There are three switches in the door, and a failure of one or more of them can cause strange behaviour when not all three switches agree on whether the door is open or closed. However, all three switches were tested to be in good working condition, so the most obvious reason is not the cause of this failure.

My microwave is an Insignia NS-MW09SS8 (a Best Buy brand), which is manufactured by Midea (FCC ID: RSFXM925AYY), with model number EMXAUXX-05-K marked on the circuit board inside. There are many other brands/models that use the same internal components. Unlike most similar models, mine has a blue LED display.

Spontaneously turning on is apparently not an uncommon failure. The [one-star reviews](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/insignia-0-9-cu-ft-compact-microwave-stainless-steel/5856600?variant=A&skuId=5856600&rating=1) on the Best Buy website for this model has almost 40 reports of this exact symptom. Many people (unnecessarily) worried that spontaneously turning on was a fire hazard. None of them seem to have found the root cause.

### What went wrong?

The microwave “turning on by itself” was caused by an aging/failing LED display. Yes, really.

This unexpected conclusion is worth a blog post explaining exactly what went wrong, why it causes the observed symptoms, and how I repaired it.

This is a summary:

*   If the lamp is on and the door is closed, the turntable and fan also turn on. The magnetron stays off, so there is no fire hazard. This is expected behaviour.
*   The control board thought the door was open even when it is actually closed. This causes the lamp to turn on.
*   This control board uses the same microcontroller GPIO pin to both drive segment A of the LED display and sense the door switch.
*   Due to aging of the display’s LEDs, there is enough reverse-biased leakage through the LEDs to cause the door switch to be incorrectly sensed as open, causing the microcontroller to incorrectly think the door was open.

### Control Board

This is a photo of both sides of the control board. The burnt discolouration on the back side underneath the LED display is due to desoldering the display with hot air for repair.

### Schematic

Here is a schematic for most of my microwave oven, reverse-engineered by following traces and cables. The schematic excludes the power supply section (switched-mode +5V and +12V supplies).

### Lamp, Fan, and Turntable

Normally, when the door is open, the lamp turns on. When cooking, the lamp, fan, and turntable all turn on. What mechanism implements this behaviour, and how does it explain the malfunctioning behaviour where the lamp, fan, and turntable are all on?

[![Image 3: Midea microwave partial schematic for lamp, fan, and turntable control](https://blog.stuffedcow.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/lamp-magnetron-min.svg)](https://blog.stuffedcow.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/lamp-magnetron-min.svg)

Above is the portion of the circuit that controls the lamp, fan, turntable, and magnetron. Notice how there is only one relay (RLY2, turned on by Q2) that controls the lamp, fan and turntable. The microcontroller actually cannot independently control these. When the microcontroller turns on the lamp relay (RLY2), the upper door switch (not the microcontroller) decides whether only the lamp turns on, or all three.

In the failed state, the microcontroller thought the door was open (according to the lower door switch) and turned on the lamp (RLY2) in response. But the door was closed according to the upper door switch, so the fan and turntable also turn on when the lamp is turned on. This behaviour is expected, but what’s unexpected is the microcontroller detecting an open door when the door is actually closed.

An interesting side effect of this design is that if the door-open lever is slightly pressed, just enough to toggle only the bottom door switch, the lamp
