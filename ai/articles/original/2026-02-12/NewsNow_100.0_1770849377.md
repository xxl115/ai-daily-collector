Can I just have an electric car that’s a car and nothing else? Seats, wheels pedals, mirrors, real buttons, no displays just a aux jack. I’d buy it, hell I might even take the risk and pre-order it

Backup cameras are required by federal law as of 2018. The intent of the law was to reduce the number of children killed by being backed over because the driver couldn't see them behind the car.

![Image 4](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46978759&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D46976911)While I agree with you that the issue is far worse with larger vehicles, I do find that backing up in my wife's 2011 camry (without a backup camera) feels significantly less safe than I feel backing up my 2017 accord with a backup camera. I'm all for fixing the structural issue you are referring to, but I think the requirement for those cameras is sane in an age where the added cost to the manufacturer is miniscule.

![Image 6](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46980717&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D46976911)I have to agree. Backing up my Tundra (8' bed) feels substantially safer since I can see immediately behind the vehicle than any pre-regulation vehicle I've driven. That doesn't even account for the convenience with lining up for towing, hauling, etc. (It's no replacement for GOAL—Get Out And Look—but it definitely helps!)

I have unusually good spatial skills. I have parallel parked and reverse parked perfectly every single time for over 5 years… …but no matter what, I cannot see behind my bumper. No mirror on any car points there.
![Image 8](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46980814&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D46976911)As someone who can only afford cars that are 10+ years old, i've never owened a car with a backup camera. And in a way-- good. That part of my brain, let it continue to develop. I am much better at "feeling out" where a car is than my friends who rely on back up cameras.

It's definitely a net positive for safety, and it probably costs the auto maker less than the seat belts (literally).

I still mostly back up the old fashioned way, and really only use the camera for very tight situations where a few inches matter.

Especially if I am parked next to something that is taller than my golf, which is most vehicles.
