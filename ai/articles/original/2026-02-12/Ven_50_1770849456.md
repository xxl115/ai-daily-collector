AI agents are breaking traditional IT operations models, adding complexity, data silos, and fragmented workflows. DJ Sampath, Cisco's SVP of AI Software and Platform, believes that AgenticOps is the solution: a new operational paradigm where humans and AI collaborate in real time to create efficiency, boost security, and allow for innovative technological applications.

In a recent conversation with VentureBeat, Sampath outlined why current enterprise IT management is fundamentally breaking and what makes AgenticOps not just useful, but necessary for IT operations going forward.

The breaking point of traditional IT operations
-----------------------------------------------

The core problem plaguing enterprise IT today is fragmentation, Sampath said.

"A lot of times inside of these enterprises, data is sitting across multiple different silos," he explained. "For an operator to come in and start troubleshooting something, they have to go through many different dashboards, many different products, and that results in an increasing amount of time spent trying to figure out what is where before they can actually get to the root cause of an issue."

This challenge is about to intensify dramatically. As AI agents become ubiquitous within enterprises, the complexity will multiply exponentially.

"Every single person is going to have at least 10 or more agents that are working on their behalf doing different types of things," Sampath said. "This problem is only going to be tenfold, if not a hundredfold worse when you start to think about what's really happening with the inclusion of agents."

Three core principles of AgenticOps
-----------------------------------

To address these challenges, Cisco has developed its AgenticOps capabilities around three fundamental design principles that Sampath believes must be true for this new operational model to succeed.

**First, unified data access across silos.** The platform must bring together disparate data sources: network data, security data, application data, and infrastructure data.

"Bringing all of that stuff together is going to be incredibly important so that the agents that you are deploying to do work on your behalf can seamlessly connect the dots across the board," Sampath said.

**Second, multiplayer-first design**. AgenticOps must be fundamentally collaborative from the ground up, enabling IT operations, security operations, network operations teams — and agents — to work together seamlessly.

"When you bring the IT ops person, the SecOps person, the NetOps person all together, you can troubleshoot and debug issues a whole lot faster than if you're working in silos and copy pasting things back and forth," he explained. "It's humans and agents working together in a synchronous environment."

**Third, purpose-built AI models**. While general-purpose AI models excel at broad tasks, specialized operations require models trained for specific domains.

"When you start to go into specializations, it becomes really important for these models to understand very specific things like network configuration or thread models that you care about and needs to be able to reason about that," he said.

How Cisco operationalizes AgenticOps across the enterprise stack
----------------------------------------------------------------

Cisco's approach unites telemetry, intelligence, and collaboration into a single coherent platform. Cisco AI Canvas is an operations workspace that replaces multiple dashboards with a generative UI and a unified collaborative experience. Within AI Canvas, operators can use natural language to delegate actions to agents — pulling telemetry, correlating signals, testing hypotheses, and executing changes — while maintaining human-in-the-loop control.

The reasoning capabilities come from Cisco's Deep Network Model, trained on over 40 years of operational data including CCIE expertise, production telemetry, Cisco’s Technical Assistance Center (TAC), and Customer Experience (CX) insights. This purpose-built model delivers domain-specific intelligence that general-purpose models cannot match.

Cisco's platform spans campus, branch, cloud, and edge environments, allowing agents to consume telemetry across the entire ecosystem at machine speed, including Meraki, ThousandEyes, and Splunk. With MCP servers implemented across Cisco products, agents gain standardized access to tools and data without custom integration work.

How fragmented reporting data undermines IT troubleshooting

The traditional approach to IT troubleshooting involves raising tickets and piecing together fragmenting information across multiple s
