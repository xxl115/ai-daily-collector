**A first look at Making AI Work, MIT Technology Review’s new AI newsletter**

Are you interested in learning more about the ways in which AI is _actually_ being used? We’ve launched a new weekly newsletter series exploring just that: digging into how generative AI is being used and deployed across sectors and what professionals need to know to apply it in their everyday work.

Each edition of [Making AI Work](https://technologyreview.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=47c1a9cec9749a8f8cbc83e78&id=23934d46f3&e=a236e356bf) begins with a case study, examining a specific use case of AI in a given industry. Then we’ll take a deeper look at the AI tool being used, with more context about how other companies or sectors are employing that same tool or system. Finally, we’ll end with action-oriented tips to help you apply the tool.

The first edition takes a look at how AI is changing health care, digging into the future of medical note-taking by learning about the Microsoft Copilot tool used by doctors at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

**Why the Moltbook frenzy was like Pokémon**

Lots of influential people in tech recently described Moltbook, [an online hangout populated by AI agents interacting with one another](https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132448/moltbook-was-peak-ai-theater/?utm_source=the_download&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*), as a glimpse into the future. It appeared to show AI systems doing useful things for the humans that created them—sure, it was flooded with crypto scams, and many of the posts were actually written by people, but _something_ about it pointed to a future of helpful AI, right?

The whole experiment reminded our senior editor for AI, Will Douglas Heaven, of something far less interesting: Pokémon.
