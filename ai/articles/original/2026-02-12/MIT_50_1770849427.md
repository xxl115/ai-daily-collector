For years, our newsroom has explored [AI’s limitations](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/16/1129946/why-its-time-to-reset-our-expectations-for-ai/) and potential dangers, as well as its [growing energy needs](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/). And our reporters have looked closely at how generative tools are being used for tasks such as [coding](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/15/1128352/rise-of-ai-coding-developers-2026/)and [running scientific experiments](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/15/1129210/ai-materials-science-discovery-startups-investment/).

But how is AI _actually_ being used in fields like health care, climate tech, education, and finance? How are small businesses using it? And what should you keep in mind if you use AI tools at work?These questions guided the creation of Making AI Work, a new AI mini-course newsletter.

[**Sign up for Making AI Work**](https://ter.li/Making-AI-Work_SignUp_WEB)to see weekly case studies exploring tools and tips for AI implementation. The limited-run newsletter will deliver practical, industry-specific guidance on how generative AI is being used and deployed across sectors and what professionals need to know to apply it in their everyday work. The goal is to help working professionals more clearly see how AI is actually being used today, and what that [looks like in practice](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/30/1126471/chatbots-are-surprisingly-effective-at-debunking-conspiracy-theories/)—including new challenges it presents.

You can sign up at any time and you’ll receive seven editions, delivered once per week, until you complete the series.

Each newsletter begins with a case study, examining a specific use case of AI in a given industry. Then we’ll take a deeper look at the AI tool being used, with more context about how other companies or sectors are employing that same tool or system. Finally, we’ll end with action-oriented tips to help you apply the tool.

Here’s a closer look at what we’ll cover:
