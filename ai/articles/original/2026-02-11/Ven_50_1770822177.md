Before addressing Global Business Services (GBS), let’s take a step back. Can agentic AI, the type of AI able to take goal-driven action, transform not just GBS but any kind of enterprise? And has it done so yet?

As with many new technologies, rhetoric has outpaced deployment in this case. While 2025 was “supposed to be the year of agentic AI,” it didn’t turn out that way, according to VentureBeat Contributing Editor Taryn Plumb. Leaning on input from Google Cloud and integrated development environment (IDE) company Replit, Plumb reported in a [December 2025 VentureBeat post](https://venturebeat.com/orchestration/even-google-and-replit-struggle-to-deploy-ai-agents-reliably-heres-why) that what has been missing are the fundamentals required to scale.

Given the experience of Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative (gen)AI, this outcome is not surprising. In a survey conducted at the February 2025 [Shared Services & Outsourcing Network (SSON) summit](https://www.ssonetwork.com/events-process-and-continuous-improvement-virtual-summit), 65% of GBS organizations responded that they had yet to complete a GenAI project. One can safely say that the adoption of the more recently arrived agentic AI is still in its very nascent stages for enterprises, including GBS.

The role of agentic AI in Global Business Services
--------------------------------------------------

There are good reasons, nonetheless, to focus on the tremendous potential of agentic AI and its application to the GBS sector.

Stripped of hype, Agentic AI unlocks capabilities in the orchestration layer of software workflows that weren’t practical before. It does so through a range of techniques, including (but not requiring) LLMs. While enterprises may indeed be missing certain fundamentals needed to deploy agentic AI at scale, those prerequisites are not out of reach.

As for GBS and Global Capability Centers (GCCs), they have already been undergoing a makeover, from back-office extensions into increasingly strategic enterprise partners. Agentic AI is a natural fit because one of its standard use cases involves IT operations or customer-service agents, functionality already within the existing GBS and GCC wheelhouse.

So yes, agentic AI could potentially transform the GBS sector. Industry leaders can best move toward scaled deployment by taking a methodical approach.

Five steps for deploying agentic AI in GBS
------------------------------------------

Agentic AI is not the only game in town. As noted, there’s GenAI, used primarily for content creation. But broadening the scope, we can also point to predictive AI and document AI, used respectively for forecasting and data extraction. (Neither requires LLMs.) Exposure to preexisting AI bodes well for the future of agentic AI.

First, these flavors of AI are mutually supportive, stacked (rather than siloed) in modern systems. Agentic AI, in particular, is positioned to draw upon the others. Second, having lived through the hype cycle of GenAI, industry leaders may be inclined to take a more measured – and productive – approach to agentic AI.

Rather than rushing into a pilot, the industry would do well to prep carefully (steps 1-3). When combined with the right test project (step 4), these actions can pave the way for a scaled-up deployment of agentic AI (step 5):

**Know thy processes**. Business operations can be complicated. Consider a top global shipping and logistics firm, whose thousands of full-time employees at its seven GBS centers supported more than 80 processes involving highly complex, manually intensive workflows with wide regional variations. Only by first understanding existing processes and workflows does an
