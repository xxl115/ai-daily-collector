**A “QuitGPT” campaign is urging people to cancel their ChatGPT subscriptions**

In September, Alfred Stephen, a freelance software developer in Singapore, purchased a ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs $20 a month and offers more access to advanced models, to speed up his work. But he grew frustrated with the chatbot’s coding abilities and its gushing, meandering replies. Then he came across a post on Reddit about a campaign called QuitGPT.

QuitGPT is one of the latest salvos in a growing movement by activists and disaffected users to cancel their subscriptions. In just the past few weeks, users have flooded Reddit with stories about quitting the chatbot. And while it’s unclear how many users have joined the boycott, there’s no denying QuitGPT is getting attention.[Read the full story](https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/10/1132577/a-quitgpt-campaign-is-urging-people-to-cancel-chatgpt-subscriptions/?utm_source=the_download&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*).

**EVs could be cheaper to own than gas cars in Africa by 2040**

Electric vehicles could be economically competitive in Africa sooner than expected. Just 1% of new cars sold across the continent in 2025 were electric, but a new analysis finds that with solar off-grid charging, EVs could be cheaper to own than gas vehicles by 2040.

There are major barriers to higher EV uptake in many countries in Africa, including a sometimes unreliable grid, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of access to affordable financing. But as batteries and the vehicles they power continue to get cheaper, the economic case for EVs is building.

**MIT Technology Review Narrated: How next-generation nuclear reactors break out of the 20th-century blueprint**

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste.

The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.

This is our latest [story](https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1129797/next-generation-nuclear-reactors-power-energy/?utm_source=the_download&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*) to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we’re publishing each week on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/6QefEeY1IKYVn5w6nUV83Y) and [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/mit-technology-review-narrated/id1523584878).
