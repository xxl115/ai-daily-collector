Title: archive.today is directing a DDOS attack against my blog

Markdown Content:
Around January 11, 2026, [archive.today](https://archive.today/) (aka archive.is, archive.md, etc) started using its users as proxies to conduct a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack against [Gyrovague](https://gyrovague.com/), my personal blog. All users encountering archive.today’s CAPTCHA page currently load and execute the following Javascript:

```
setInterval(function() {
            fetch("https://gyrovague.com/?s=" + Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 3 + Math.random() * 8), {
                referrerPolicy: "no-referrer",
                mode: "no-cors"
            });
        }, 300);
```

Every 300 milliseconds, as long as the CAPTCHA page is open, this makes a request to the search function of my blog using a random string, ensuring the response cannot be cached and thus consumes resources.

You can validate this yourself by checking the source code and network requests; if you’re not being redirected to the CAPTCHA page, [here’s a screenshot](https://files.catbox.moe/20jsle.png). uBlock Origin also stops the requests from being executed, so you may need to turn that off. At time of writing, the code above is located at line 136 of the CAPTCHA page’s top level HTML file:

So how did we end up here?

On **August 5, 2023**, I published a blog post called [archive.today: On the trail of the mysterious guerrilla archivist of the Internet](https://gyrovague.com/2023/08/05/archive-today-on-the-trail-of-the-mysterious-guerrilla-archivist-of-the-internet/). Using what cool kids these days call [OSINT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence), meaning poking around with my favorite search engine, the post examines the history of the site, its tech stack and its funding. The post mentions three names/aliases linked to the site, but all of them had been dug up by previous sleuths and the blog post also concludes that they are all most likely aliases, so as far as “doxxing” goes, this wasn’t terribly effective.

My motives for publishing this have been questioned, sometimes in fanciful ways. The actual rationale is boringly straightforward: I found it curious that we know so little about this widely-used service, so I dug into it, in the same way that previous posts dug into a [sketchy crypto coin offering](https://gyrovague.com/2017/06/16/monaco-doing-the-math-on-an-ico-where-the-house-always-wins/), [monetization dark patterns in a popular pay to win game](https://gyrovague.com/2013/06/05/time-is-money-how-clash-of-clans-earns-500000-a-day-with-in-app-purchases/), and the [end of subway construction in Japan](https://gyrovague.com/2015/12/18/the-last-subway-line-in-japan/). That’s it, and it’s also the only post on my blog that references archive.today.

The post gathered some 10,000 views and [a bit discussion on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37009598), but didn’t exactly set the blogosphere on fire. And indeed, absolutely nothing happened for the next two years and a bit.

On **November 5, 2025**, [Heise Online](https://www.heise.de/en/news/Archive-today-FBI-Demands-Data-from-Provider-Tucows-11066346.html) reported that the FBI was now on the trail of archive.today and had subpoenaed its domain registrar Tucows. Both this report and [ArsTechnica](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/fbi-subpoena-tries-to-unmask-mysterious-founder-of-archive-today/) also linked to my blog post.

On **November 13**, AdGuard DNS published an [interesting blog post](https://adguard-dns.io/en/blog/archive-today-adguard-dns-block-demand.html) about a sketchy French organization called [Web Abuse Association Defense](https://www.webabusedefense.com/) (WAAD), which was trying to pressure them into blocking archive.today’s various domains. An update added on November 18 also suggests that WAAD is impersonating other people.

On **January 8**, **2026**, my blog host Automattic (dba WordPress.com) notified me that they had received a GDPR complaint from a “Nora Puchreiner”, alleging that my blog post _“contains extensive personal data … presented in a narrative that is defamatory in tone and context”_. The complaint was entirely lacking in actionable detail, so I had Gemini compose a rebuttal citing journalistic exemption, public interest, failure to identify falsehoods, and host protection, and after a quick review Automattic sided with me and left the post up. Score one for AI.

On **January 10**, I received a politely worded e
