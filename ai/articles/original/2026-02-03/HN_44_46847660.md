Cookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.

Illustrations

*   Most purposes explained in this notice rely on the storage or accessing of information from your device when you use an app or visit a website. For example, a vendor or publisher might need to store a cookie on your device during your first visit on a website, to be able to recognise your device during your next visits (by accessing this cookie each time).

Number of Vendors seeking consent: 777

Use limited data to select advertising

Legitimate Interest

- [x] 

Consent

- [x] 

Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).

Illustrations

*   A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
*   A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.

Number of Vendors seeking consent or relying on legitimate interest: 734

Create profiles for personalised advertising

Consent

- [x] 

Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.

Illustrations

*   If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
*   An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

Number of Vendors seeking consent: 594

Use profiles to select personalised advertising

Consent

- [x] 

Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.

Illustrations

*   An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.
*   A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.

Create profiles to personalise content

Consent

- [x] 

Information about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.

Illustrations

*   You read several articles on how to build a treehouse on a social media platform. This information might be added to a profile to mark your interest in content related to outdoors as well as do-it-yourself guides (with the objective of allowing the personalisation of content, so that for example you are presented with more blog posts and articles on treehouses and wood cabins in the future).
*   You have viewed three videos on space exploration across different TV apps. An unrelated news platform with which you have had no contact builds a profile based on that viewing behaviour, marking space exploration as a topic of possible interest for other videos.

Number of Vendors seeking consent: 267

Use profiles to select personalised content

Consent

- [x] 

Content presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.

Illustrations

*   You read articles on vegetarian food on a social media platform and then use the cooking app of an unrelated company. The profile built about you on the social media platform will be used to present you vegetarian recipes on the welcome screen of the cooking app.
*   You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.

Measure advertising performance

Legitimate Interest

- [x] 

Consent

- [x] 

Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.

Illustrations

*   You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
*   You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.

Consent

- [x] 

Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.

Illustrations

*   You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
*   You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.

Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources

Legitimate Interest

- [x] 

Consent

- [x] 

Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).

Illustrations

*   The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
*   An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.

Illustrations

*   A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.
*   An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.

Consent

- [x] 

Content presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).

Illustrations

*   A travel magazine has published an article on its website about the new online courses proposed by a language school, to improve travelling experiences abroad. The school’s blog posts are inserted directly at the bottom of the page, and selected on the basis of your non-precise location (for instance, blog posts explaining the course curriculum for different languages than the language of the country you are situated in).
*   A sports news mobile app has started a new section of articles covering the most recent football games. Each article includes videos hosted by a separate streaming platform showcasing the highlights of each match. If you fast-forward a video, this information may be used to select a shorter video to play next.

 Special Purposes (3) 

Ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors

Your data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.

Illustrations

*   An advertising intermediary delivers ads from various advertisers to its network of partnering websites. It notices a large increase in clicks on ads relating to one advertiser, and uses data regarding the source of the clicks to determine that 80% of the clicks come from bots rather than humans.

Number of Vendors seeking consent: 595

Deliver and present advertising and content

Certain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.

Illustrations

*   Clicking on a link in an article might normally send you to another page or part of the article. To achieve this, 1°) your browser sends a request to a server linked to the website, 2°) the server answers back (“here is the article you asked for”), using technical information automatically included in the request sent by your device, to properly display the information / images that are part of the article you asked for. Technically, such exchange of information is necessary to deliver the content that appears on your screen.

Number of Vendors seeking consent: 594

50 years ago, a young Bill Gates took on the ‘software pirates’
===============================================================

 "Open Letter to Hobbyists," sparked a decade-long conflict between proprietary software interests and the burgeoning hacker community, ultimately paving the way for the modern open source movement.

 Manhattan Rare Book Company. 

Just months after his 20th birthday, [Bill Gates](https://thenewstack.io/netflixs-bill-gates-documentary-reveals-a-restless-mind-still-hard-at-work/) had already angered the programmer community.

As the first home computers began appearing in the 1970s, the world faced a question: Would its software be free?

This week marks the 50th anniversary of the day young Gates penned his infamous 1976 “[Open Letter to Hobbyists](https://www.manhattanrarebooks.com/pages/books/2635/bill-gates/an-open-letter-to-hobbyists?soldItem=true),” complaining that his very first piece of commercial software had been pirated. It kicked off a series of reverberations, along with a major controversy that would continue boiling over the next half century — and ultimately shape the world we live and work in today.

‘A sea of blank canvases’
-------------------------

I asked Bruce Perens, who created the original [Open Source](https://thenewstack.io/open-source/) definition in 1997, if he remembered Bill Gates’ letter in 1976. At the time, Perens was just 19, so “I was just out of high school and could not afford any kind of computer!”

Still, he recognizes that the historic document contains its own ironies — if not all the outlines of a struggle that was yet to come. “I think the most interesting thing about the letter… is that so many people thought at the time that you needed a company to develop something like BASIC, when it was really only written by one or two people. It would be someone’s hobby project today!”

In 1976, 20-year-old Bill Gates was “a slim blond genius who looked even younger than his tender years,” Steven Levy wrote in his book _Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution_.

Working with 22-year-old Paul Allen (with some code from “hired” math programmer Monte Davidoff), Gates [created a version of the BASIC programming language for the Altair 8800](https://thenewstack.io/bill-gates-paul-allen-and-the-code-that-started-microsoft/), which was destined to become the world’s first commercially successful home computer.

Ed Roberts, the head of the company, had then hired Allen (and let Gates work remotely) to write software for his **micro**computer, leading Gates and Allen to decide the logical name for their software-writing enterprise would be: Micro-Soft.

Levy got the story of what happened next from a Berkeley building contractor turned [Homebrew Computing Club](https://thenewstack.io/steve-wozniak-reunites-with-the-historic-homebrew-computer-club/) member, Steve Dompier. After a demo in Palo Alto, “Somebody, I don’t think anyone figured out who, borrowed one of their paper tapes lying on the floor” — the tape holding the entirety of the Gates/Allen/Davidoff Altair BASIC code.

Silicon Valley systems tester Dan Sokol was asked if he had a way of _duplicating_ tapes — to which the answer was yes. Sokol graced the next Homebrew Computing Club meeting with a box full of copies, Levy writes, charging “what in hacker terms was the proper price for software: nothing.”

In fact, there was an expectation that people would make and share copies of whatever they received. The result? “That first version of Altair BASIC was in free-flowing circulation even before its official release.”

‘Most of you steal your software!’
----------------------------------

Expecting royalties, a none-too-happy Gates issued his “Open Letter to Hobbyists” in Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems’ (MITS) next _Altair Users’ Newsletter._ MITS was the Albuquerque-based company behind the Altair.

Gates also had published the screed elsewhere, including the Homebrew Computer Club’s newsletter.

“Most of you steal your software…” wrote 20-year-old Gates. “Who cares if the people who worked on it get paid?”

Gates argued that just the computer time they’d used had a value of over $40,000.

Homebrew club member [Lee Felsenstein](https://computerhistory.org/profile/lee-felsenstein/) said later in [an oral history for Silicon Valley’s Computer History Museum](https://technical.ly/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lee-felsenstein-oral-history.pdf) that they all knew that number was “funny money… You never pay that much for computer time… We all knew this to be a spurious argument.”

Nonetheless, Gates estimated that 90% of Altair users had never purchased a copy of BASIC — and that (due to their lack of sales) their two months of work came out to $2 an hour. This stifled the creation of better software, Gates argued.

“Who can afford to do professional work for nothing?” he wrote.

“I would appreciate letters from any one who wants to pay up,” Gates closed his letter, giving his address at the Portals apartment complex in Albuquerque, New Mexico, also welcoming letters from anyone who “has a suggestion or comment.”

Gates received between 300 and 400 letters, Levy wrote later — many of them “intensely negative,” while “only five or six” contained the payment Gates requested.

> “Well, there’s the actual industry where there’s trying to make money and there’s those hobbyists where we’re trying to make things happen.”

The price for a stand-alone copy of MITS’ version of BASIC was $500, Felsenstein said later. But in 1976, $500 was the equivalent of thousands of today’s dollars, and just to learn how to use those primitive early home computers, Felsenstein said, “we’d invested far more in terms of our time and brainpower and so forth.”

“So no one was much in a mood to say, ‘Oh, I’ll just come up with another $500 here and give it to them.'”

But more importantly, “This, kind of, delineated a rift within the industry. Well, there’s the actual industry where there’s trying to make money and there’s those hobbyists where we’re trying to make things happen,” Felsenstein said.

‘All hell broke loose’
----------------------

Gates had closed his letter with a positive scenario for hobbyists. “Nothing would please me more than being able to hire ten programmers and deluge the hobby market with good software.”

Instead, “All hell broke loose in the hacker community,” Levy writes.

The long-standing community who’d prided themselves on “hacking” away superfluous lines of code in other people’s programs now didn’t want to abandon the idea “that computer programs belonged to everybody. It was too much a part of the hacker dream to abandon.”

Presumably in response to Gates’ letter, an [early Apple 1 ad](http://apple1.chez.com/Apple1project/Gallery/Gallery.htm) later that year emphasized that “since our philosophy is to provide software for our machines free or at minimal cost, you won’t be continually paying for access to this growing software library.”

Levy notes that when [Jim Warren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Warren_(computer_specialist)) first announced he’d be editing the legendary software magazine [_Dr. Dobbs Journal_](https://thenewstack.io/dr-dobbs-says-farewell/), he even specifically wrote that “There is a viable alternative to the problems raised by Bill Gates in his irate letter to computer hobbyists concerning ‘ripping off’ software. When software is free, or so inexpensive that it’s easier to pay for it than duplicate it, then it won’t be ‘stolen.'”

And soon hobbyists were crafting their own sub-4K “[Tiny BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC)” interpreters as an alternative to the Micro-Soft version. This led to the first occurrence of the now-famous phrase “Copyleft” — in [October of 1976](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Copyleft_All_Wrongs_Reserved.png).

But ironically, Felsenstein believes National Semiconductor later licensed Microsoft’s version of BASIC because it was clearly the most popular — since “everybody had copied it and everybody was using it.” So in effect, “we made Microsoft the standard BASIC… the hobbyists did the marketing.”

And within five years Microsoft had also landed an even more important deal: providing IBM with their MS-DOS operating system in 1980…

But Gates didn’t surrender. Three months after his original letter, Gates published [a follow-up](https://web.archive.org/web/20120508210928/http://startup.nmnaturalhistory.org/gallery/notesViewerLarge.php?ii=76_4&p=5), saying he hoped the attention “means that serious consideration is being given to the issue of the future of software development and distribution for the hobbyist.”

Although back at MITS, Gates and Allen just abandoned royalty-based pricing and switched to fixed-rate software production for their work.

Referencing his earlier “thieves” comment, Gates wrote in his second letter that the majority of hobbyists “are intelligent and honest individuals who share my concern for the future of software development.” He says he received letters from hobbyists “who saw the stealing going on and were unhappy about it”, as well as from small companies “that are reluctant to provide software because they don’t think enough people will buy the software to justify its development.”

And by the dawn of [the Apple II era](https://thenewstack.io/a-new-book-about-the-apple-ii-age-celebrates-the-users/), thousands of programs were being written — and _sold_ — for Apple’s next device. As the market for software grew, major companies [like IBM](https://web.archive.org/web/20170904075121/http://landley.net/history/mirror/ibm/oco.html) and [AT&T](https://thenewstack.io/not-expected-understand-explainer/) began changing the licensing on their code. 1980 even saw the passage of “The Computer Software Copyright Act” (according to [a history](https://www.c2st.org/the-computer-software-copyright-act-of-1980/) from the Chicago Council on Science and Technology).

And 1998’s [Digital Millennium Copyright Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) finally criminalized copyright-circumventing technology.

‘So I asked Steve Jobs…’
------------------------

Yet somewhere along the way, the seeds had been planted for a movement that would transform much of the tech world. “We really owe it to Richard Stallman for making the point that you didn’t need a company for all of this stuff,” Perens said.

It was Stallman who officially created the Free Software Movement in 1983, coinciding with the launch of the GNU Project in 1983 to provide alternatives to proprietary Unix tools. Perens acknowledges that “many people never got to hear about Free Software, while Open Source ended up being a lot more popular.

“I still maintain that Open Source is just a different way to market what Stallman started.”

[![Image 5: The GNU Logo (via Wikipedia) - Creative Commons license](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2026/01/d37418c2-1280px-heckert_gnu_white.svg1_-300x293.png) Zoom](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2026/01/d37418c2-1280px-heckert_gnu_white.svg1_-300x293.png)

Open/free software gathered momentum with the release of the Linux kernel in 1991, and then the publication of the official Open Source definition in 1998. Bruce Perens was that definition’s primary author (with input from a mailing list of Debian developers), and he illustrates where we ended up with an evocative story. “When I left Pixar in 2000, I stopped in Steve Job’s office — which for some reason was right across the hall from mine. I wasn’t important, so maybe management wanted to watch me!”

Perens had accepted a position as senior Linux/Open Source Global Strategist for Hewlett-Packard, which he describes as leaving Apple “to work on Open Source. So I asked Steve: ‘You still don’t believe in this Linux stuff, do you?'” And Perens still remembers how Steve Jobs had responded.

“I’ve had a lot to do with building two of the world’s three great operating systems” — which Jobs considered to be NeXT OS, MacOS and Windows. “‘And it took a billion-dollar lab to make each one.

“So no, I don’t think you can do this.'”

And then Perens shares the story’s triumphant punchline. “But I won that argument!

“Three years later, Steve stood onstage in front of a slide that said ‘Open Source: We Think It’s Great!’ as he introduced the Safari browser, which at that time was based on the browser engine developed by the KDE Open Source project!”
