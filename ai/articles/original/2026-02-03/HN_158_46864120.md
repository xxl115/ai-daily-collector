Firefox Getting New Controls to Turn Off AI Features
====================================================

Monday February 2, 2026 3:46 pm PST by [Juli Clover](https://www.macrumors.com/author/juli-clover/)

The Firefox browser is gaining options to turn off AI enhancements, Mozilla [said today](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/firefox/ai-controls/). Firefox users who prefer to browse without artificial intelligence will be able to turn off several AI features that Mozilla has added over the last several months.

![Image 40: firefox ai toggle](https://images.macrumors.com/t/odHITJ0hJsNJs7NAz4zRZ52iCLQ=/400x0/article-new/2026/02/firefox-ai-toggle.jpg?lossy)

Here's what can be disabled:

*   Translations, which help you browse the web in your preferred language.
*   Alt text in PDFs, which add accessibility descriptions to images in PDF pages.
*   AI-enhanced tab grouping, which suggests related tabs and group names.
*   Link previews, which show key points before you open a link.
*   AI chatbot in the sidebar, which lets you use your chosen chatbot as you browse, including options like Anthropic Claude, ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini and Le Chat Mistral.

The AI features can be disabled entirely or individually, so users can pick and choose what they want to use. Users will be able to continue to opt out of AI features as they are added in the browser, and the main Block AI Enhancements toggle will disable all current and future AI features, including pop-ups or reminders to use existing or upcoming AI features.

Mozilla says that it wants to be able to continue to build AI options for those who want them, while also giving those who don't a way to disable them.

AI controls will be added in Firefox 148, which is set to start rolling out to users on February 24.

Apple today confirmed to Reuters that it has acquired Q.ai, an Israeli startup that is working on artificial intelligence technology for audio. Apple paid close to $2 billion for Q.ai, according to sources cited by the Financial Times. That would make this Apple's second-biggest acquisition ever, after it paid $3 billion for the popular headphone and audio brand Beats in 2014. Q.ai has...

Last year, Apple launched CarPlay Ultra, the long-awaited next-generation version of its CarPlay software system for vehicles. Nearly nine months later, CarPlay Ultra is still limited to Aston Martin's latest luxury vehicles, but that should change fairly soon. In May 2025, Apple said many other vehicle brands planned to offer CarPlay Ultra, including Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis. In his Powe...

Apple recently updated its online store with a new ordering process for Macs, including the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro. There used to be a handful of standard configurations available for each Mac, but now you must configure a Mac entirely from scratch on a feature-by-feature basis. In other words, ordering a new Mac now works much like ordering an...

The calendar has turned to February, and a new report indicates that Apple's next product launch is "imminent," in the form of new MacBook Pro models.

This is good, and should be how things work...users should have the option of turning AI functions on or off individually. Some of it may be useful for some people and not others, and companies should respect that. Hopefully others follow this so that we can choose how much AI we get in our lives.

These are all available to be disabled in about:config, but it's a pain and requires more know-how than it should. Shameful that they forced this on their users for so long.
