Demand for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them has never been hotter.

In 2025, EVs made up over [a quarter](https://electrek.co/2025/12/17/25-percent-of-new-cars-sold-globally-are-evs-heres-who-is-buying-them/) of new vehicle sales globally, up from less than 5% in 2020. Some regions are seeing even higher uptake: In China, [more than 50%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-14/china-is-poised-to-buy-more-evs-than-gas-only-cars-this-year) of new vehicle sales last year were battery electric or plug-in hybrids. In Europe, [more purely electric vehicles](https://insideevs.com/news/785541/ev-sales-surpass-gas-cars-europe-first-time/) hit the roads in December than gas-powered ones. (The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales [decline](https://cleantechnica.com/2026/01/18/us-ev-sales-drop-2-in-2025-but-up-162-compared-to-2021/) from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Looking ahead, we could soon see wider adoption of new chemistries, including some that deliver lower costs or higher performance. Meanwhile, the geopolitics of batteries are shifting, and so is the policy landscape. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

### **A big opportunity for sodium-ion batteries**

Lithium-ion batteries are the default chemistry used in EVs, personal devices, and even stationary storage systems on the grid today. But in a tough environment in some markets like the US, there’s a growing interest in cheaper alternatives. Automakers right now largely care just about batteries’ cost, regardless of performance improvements, says Kara Rodby, a technical principal at Volta Energy Technologies, a venture capital firm that focuses on energy storage technology.

Sodium-ion cells have long been held up as a potentially less expensive alternative to lithium. The batteries are limited in their energy density, so they deliver a shorter range than lithium-ion. But sodium is also more abundant, so they could be cheaper.

Sodium’s growth has been cursed, however, by the very success of lithium-based batteries, says Shirley Meng, a professor of molecular engineering at the University of Chicago. A lithium-ion battery cell cost $568 per kilowatt-hour in 2013, but that cost had fallen to just [$74 per kilowatt-hour](https://about.bnef.com/insights/clean-transport/lithium-ion-battery-pack-prices-fall-to-108-per-kilowatt-hour-despite-rising-metal-prices-bloombergnef/) by 2025—quite the moving target for cheaper alternatives to chase.

Sodium-ion batteries currently cost about [$59 per kilowatt-hour](https://www.woodmac.com/blogs/energy-pulse/sodium-ion-batteries-enter-energy-storage-market/) on average. That’s less expensive than the average lithium-ion battery. But if you consider only lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells, a lower-end type of lithium-ion battery that averages $52 per kilowatt-hour, sodium is still more expensive today.

We could soon see an opening for sodium-batteries, though. Lithium prices have been [ticking up in recent months](https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/22/1131563/lithium-2026/), a shift that could soon slow or reverse the steady downward march of prices for lithium-based batteries.

Sodium-ion batteries are already being used commercially, largely for stationary storage on the grid. But we’re starting to see sodium-ion cells incorporated into vehicles, too. The Chinese companies Yadea, JMEV, and HiNa Battery have all started producing sodium-ion batteries in limited numbers for EVs, including small, short-range cars and electric scooters that don’t require a battery with high energy density. CATL, a Chinese battery company that’s the world’s largest, says it recently began producing sodium-ion cells. The company plans to launch its first EV using the chemistry [by the middle of this year](https://electrek.co/2026/01/23/ev-battery-leader-plans-first-sodium-ion-batteries-passenger-cars/).

A location I care about is.

Today, both production and demand for sodium-ion batteries are heavily centered in China. That’s likely to continue, especially after a cutback in tax credits and other financial support for the battery and EV industries in the US. One of the biggest sodium-battery companies in the US, Natron, [ceased operations](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/05/natrons-liquidation-shows-why-the-us-isnt-ready-to-make-its-own-batteries/) last year after running into funding issues.

We could also see progress in sodium-ion
