**Microbes could extract the metal needed for cleantech**

In a pine forest on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the only active nickel mine in the US is nearing the end of its life. At a time when carmakers want the metal for electric-vehicle batteries, nickel concentration at Eagle Mine is falling and could soon drop too low to warrant digging.

Demand for nickel, copper, and rare earth elements is rapidly increasing amid the explosive growth of metal-intensive data centers, electric cars, and renewable energy projects. But producing these metals is becoming harder and more expensive because miners have already exploited the best resources.

**What we’ve been getting wrong about AI’s truth crisis**

_—James O'Donnell_ What would it take to convince you that the era of truth decay we were long warned about—where AI content dupes us, shapes our beliefs even when we catch the lie, and erodes societal trust in the process—is now here?

A [story I published last week](https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/29/1131938/dhs-is-using-google-and-adobe-ai-to-make-videos/?utm_source=the_download&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*) pushed me over the edge. And it also made me realize that the tools we were sold as a cure for this crisis are failing miserably.

**TR10: Hyperscale AI data centers**

In sprawling stretches of farmland and industrial parks, supersized buildings packed with racks of computers are springing up to fuel the AI race.

These engineering marvels are a new species of infrastructure: supercomputers designed to train and run large language models at mind-­bending scale, complete with their own specialized chips, cooling systems, and even energy supplies. But all that impressive computing power comes at a cost.

**Quote of the day**

**“In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale…I mean, space is called ‘space’ for a reason.”**

—Elon Musk explains his rationale for combining SpaceX with xAI in a [blog post](https://www.spacex.com/updates#xai-joins-spacex).

**One more thing**

[![Image 1](https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image_96cac6.png)](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/21/1122035/ukraines-largest-starlink-repair-shop/?utm_source=the_download&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&utm_term=&utm_content=02-02-2026&mc_cid=506f957352&mc_eid=a236e356bf)

**On the ground in Ukraine’s largest Starlink repair shop**Starlink is absolutely critical to Ukraine’s ability to continue in the fight against Russia. It’s how troops in battle zones stay connected with faraway HQs; it’s how many of the drones essential to Ukraine’s survival hit their targets; it’s even how soldiers stay in touch with spouses and children back home.

However, Donald Trump’s fickle foreign policy and reports suggesting Elon Musk might remove Ukraine’s access to the services have cast the technology’s future in the country into doubt.

For now Starlink access largely comes down to the unofficial community of users and engineers, including the expert “Dr. Starlink”—famous for his creative ways of customizing the systems—who have kept Ukraine in the fight, both on and off the front line. He gave _MIT Technology Review_ exclusive access to his unofficial Starlink repair workshop in the city of Lviv.
