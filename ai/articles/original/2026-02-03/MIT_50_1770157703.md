For the last couple of years, I’ve been following the progress of a group of individuals who believe death is humanity’s “core problem.” Put simply, they say death is wrong—for everyone. They’ve even said it’s _morally_ wrong.

They established what they consider a new philosophy, and[they called it Vitalism](https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/29/1131815/vitalism-longevity-enthusiasts-influence/?utm_source=the_checkup&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=the_checkup.unpaid.engagement&utm_content=01-29-26).

Vitalism is more than a philosophy, though—it’s a movement for hardcore longevity enthusiasts who want to make real progress in finding treatments that slow or reverse aging. Not just through scientific advances, but by persuading influential people to support their movement, and by changing laws and policies to open up access to experimental drugs.

And they’re starting to make progress.

**Vitalism was founded by Adam Gries and Nathan Cheng**—two men who united over their shared desire to find ways to extend human lifespan. I first saw Cheng speak back in 2023, at Zuzalu, a pop-up city in Montenegro for people who were interested in life extension and some other technologies. (It was an interesting experience—you can read more about it[here](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/05/31/1073750/new-longevity-state-rhode-island/?utm_source=the_checkup&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=the_checkup.unpaid.engagement&utm_content=01-29-26).)

Zuzalu was where Gries and Cheng officially launched Vitalism. But I’ve been closely following the longevity scene since 2022. That journey took me to Switzerland, Honduras, and a compound in Berkeley, California, where like-minded longevity enthusiasts shared their dreams of life extension.

It also took me to Washington, DC, where, last year, supporters of lifespan extension pre
