🧠 Build Your Own Coding Agent via a Step-by-Step Workshop
==========================================================

[](http://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-build-a-coding-agent#-build-your-own-coding-agent-via-a-step-by-step-workshop)

Welcome! 👋 This workshop will guide you through building your own **AI-powered coding assistant** — starting from a basic chatbot, and adding powerful tools like file reading, shell command execution, and code searching.

You don’t need to be an AI expert. Just follow along and build step-by-step!

🌐 **Want a detailed overview?** Check out the blog post: [ghuntley.com/agent](https://ghuntley.com/agent/)

* * *

🎯 What You'll Learn
--------------------

[](http://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-build-a-coding-agent#-what-youll-learn)

By the end of this workshop, you’ll understand how to:

*   ✅ Connect to the Anthropic Claude API
*   ✅ Build a simple AI chatbot
*   ✅ Add tools like reading files, editing code, and running commands
*   ✅ Handle tool requests and errors
*   ✅ Build an agent that gets smarter with each step

* * *

🛠️ What We're Building
-----------------------

[](http://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-build-a-coding-agent#%EF%B8%8F-what-were-building)

You’ll build 6 versions of a coding assistant.

Each version adds more features:

1.   **Basic Chat** — talk to Claude
2.   **File Reader** — read code files
3.   **File Explorer** — list files in folders
4.   **Command Runner** — run shell commands
5.   **File Editor** — modify files
6.   **Code Search** — search your codebase with patterns

🧱 How It Works (Architecture)
------------------------------

[](http://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-build-a-coding-agent#-how-it-works-architecture)

Each agent works like this:

1.   Waits for your input
2.   Sends it to Claude
3.   Claude may respond directly or ask to use a tool
4.   The agent runs the tool (e.g., read a file)
5.   Sends the result back to Claude
6.   Claude gives you the final answer

We call this the **event loop** — it's like the agent's heartbeat.

🚀 Getting Started
------------------

[](http://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-build-a-coding-agent#-getting-started)

### ✅ Prerequisites

[](http://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-build-a-coding-agent#-prerequisites)

*   Go 1.24.2+ or [devenv](https://devenv.sh/) (recommended for easy setup)
*   An [Anthropic API Key](https://www.anthropic.com/product/claude)

### 🔧 Set Up Your Environment

[](http://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-build-a-coding-agent#-set-up-your-environment)

**Option 1: Recommended (using devenv)**

undefinedshell
devenv shell  # Loads everything you need
undefined

**Option 2: Manual setup**

undefinedshell
# Make sure Go is installed
go mod tidy
undefined

### 🔐 Add Your API Key

[](http://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-build-a-coding-agent#-add-your-api-key)

undefinedshell
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
undefined

* * *

🏁 Start with the Basics
------------------------

[](http://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-build-a-coding-agent#-start-with-the-basics)

### 1. `chat.go` — Basic Chat

[](http://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-build-a-coding-agent#1-chatgo--basic-chat)

A simple chatbot that talks to Claude.

undefinedshell
go run chat.go
undefined

*   ➡️ Try: “Hello!”
*   ➡️ Add `--verbose` to see detailed logs

* * *

🛠️ Add Tools (One Step at a Time)
----------------------------------

[](http://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-build-a-coding-agent#%EF%B8%8F-add-tools-one-step-at-a-time)

### 2. `read.go` — Read Files

[](http://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-build-a-coding-agent#2-readgo--read-files)

Now Claude can read files from your computer.

undefinedshell
go run read.go
undefined

*   ➡️ Try: “Read fizzbuzz.js”

* * *

### 3. `list_files.go` — Explore Folders

[](http://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-build-a-coding-agent#3-list_filesgo--explore-folders)

Lets Claude look around your directory.

undefinedshell
go run list_files.go
undefined

*   ➡️ Try: “List all files in this folder”
*   ➡️ Try: “What’s in fizzbuzz.js?”

* * *

### 4. `bash_tool.go` — Run Shell Commands

[](http://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-build-a-coding-agent#4-bash_toolgo--run-shell-commands)

Allows Claude to run safe terminal commands.

undefinedshell
go run bash_tool.go
undefined

*   ➡️ Try: “Run git status”
*   ➡️ Try: “List all .go files using bash”

* * *

### 5. `edit_tool.go` — Edit Files

[](http://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-build-a-coding-agent#5-edit_toolgo--edit-files)

Claude can now **modify code**, create files, and make changes.

undefinedshell
go run edit_tool.go
undefined

*   ➡️ Try: “Create a Python hello world script”
*   ➡️ Try: “Add a comment to the top of fizzbuzz.js”

* * *

### 6. `code_search_tool.go` — Search Code

[](http://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-build-a-coding-agent#6-code_search_toolgo--search-code)

Use pattern search (powered by [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)).

undefinedshell
go run code_search_tool.go
undefined

*   ➡️ Try: “Find all function definitions in Go files”
*   ➡️ Try: “Search for TODO comments”

* * *

🧪 Sample Files (Already Included)
----------------------------------

[](http://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-build-a-coding-agent#-sample-files-already-included)

1.   `fizzbuzz.js`: for file reading and editing
2.   `riddle.txt`: a fun text file to explore
3.   `AGENT.md`: info about the project environment

* * *

🐞 Troubleshooting
------------------

[](http://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-build-a-coding-agent#-troubleshooting)

**API key not working?**

*   Make sure it’s exported: `echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
*   Check your quota on [Anthropic’s dashboard](https://www.anthropic.com/)

**Go errors?**

*   Run `go mod tidy`
*   Make sure you’re using Go 1.24.2 or later

**Tool errors?**

*   Use `--verbose` for full error logs
*   Check file paths and permissions

**Environment issues?**

*   Use `devenv shell` to avoid config problems

* * *

💡 How Tools Work (Under the Hood)
----------------------------------

[](http://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-build-a-coding-agent#-how-tools-work-under-the-hood)

Tools are like plugins. You define:

*   **Name** (e.g., `read_file`)
*   **Input Schema** (what info it needs)
*   **Function** (what it does)

Example tool definition in Go:

undefinedgo
var ToolDefinition = ToolDefinition{
    Name:        "read_file",
    Description: "Reads the contents of a file",
    InputSchema: GenerateSchema[ReadFileInput](),
    Function:    ReadFile,
}
undefined

Schema generation uses Go structs — so it’s easy to define and reuse.

* * *

🧭 Workshop Path: Learn by Building
-----------------------------------

[](http://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-build-a-coding-agent#-workshop-path-learn-by-building)

| Phase | What to Focus On |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | `chat.go`: API integration and response handling |
| **2** | `read.go`: Tool system, schema generation |
| **3** | `list_files.go`: Multiple tools, file system |
| **4** | `bash_tool.go`: Shell execution, error capture |
| **5** | `edit_tool.go`: File editing, safety checks |
| **6** | `code_search_tool.go`: Pattern search, ripgrep |

* * *

🛠️ Developer Environment (Optional)
------------------------------------

[](http://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-build-a-coding-agent#%EF%B8%8F-developer-environment-optional)

If you use [`devenv`](https://devenv.sh/), it gives you:

*   Go, Node, Python, Rust, .NET
*   Git and other dev tools

undefinedshell
devenv shell   # Load everything
devenv test    # Run checks
hello          # Greeting script
undefined

* * *
