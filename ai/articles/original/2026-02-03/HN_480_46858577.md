Note: this page tends be neglected and is only updated occasionally. The links to the left are where the useful bits are hiding.

For the past 30+ years I’ve been the maintainer of [sudo](https://www.sudo.ws/). I’m currently in search of a sponsor to fund continued sudo maintenance and development. If you or your organization is interested in sponsoring sudo, please let me know.

I also work on [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/), though my I’m not as active there as I once was.

In the past, I’ve made large contributions to [ISC cron](https://github.com/vixie/cron), among other projects.
