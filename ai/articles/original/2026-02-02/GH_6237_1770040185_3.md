Cursor Talk to Figma MCP
------------------------

[](http://github.com/grab/cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp#cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp)
This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration between Cursor AI and Figma, allowing Cursor to communicate with Figma for reading designs and modifying them programmatically.

Project Structure
-----------------

[](http://github.com/grab/cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp#project-structure)
*   `src/talk_to_figma_mcp/` - TypeScript MCP server for Figma integration
*   `src/cursor_mcp_plugin/` - Figma plugin for communicating with Cursor
*   `src/socket.ts` - WebSocket server that facilitates communication between the MCP server and Figma plugin

Get Started
-----------

[](http://github.com/grab/cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp#get-started)
1.   Install Bun if you haven't already:

curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

1.   Run setup, this will also install MCP in your Cursor's active project

bun setup

1.   Start the Websocket server

bun socket

1.   **NEW** Install Figma plugin from [Figma community page](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1485687494525374295/cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp-plugin) or [install locally](http://github.com/grab/cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp#figma-plugin)

Design Automation Example
-------------------------

[](http://github.com/grab/cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp#design-automation-example)
**Bulk text content replacement**

Thanks to [@dusskapark](https://github.com/dusskapark) for contributing the bulk text replacement feature. Here is the [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j05gGT3xfCs).

**Instance Override Propagation** Another contribution from [@dusskapark](https://github.com/dusskapark) Propagate component instance overrides from a source instance to multiple target instances with a single command. This feature dramatically reduces repetitive design work when working with component instances that need similar customizations. Check out our [demo video](https://youtu.be/uvuT8LByroI).

Development
-----------

[](http://github.com/grab/cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp#development)
### Building the Figma Plugin

[](http://github.com/grab/cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp#building-the-figma-plugin)
1.   Navigate to the Figma plugin directory:

```
cd src/cursor_mcp_plugin
``` 
2.   Edit code.js and ui.html

Best Practices
--------------

[](http://github.com/grab/cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp#best-practices)
When working with the Figma MCP:

1.   Always join a channel before sending commands
2.   Get document overview using `get_document_info` first
3.   Check current selection with `get_selection` before modifications
4.   Use appropriate creation tools based on needs: 
    *   `create_frame` for containers
    *   `create_rectangle` for basic shapes
    *   `create_text` for text elements

5.   Verify changes using `get_node_info`
6.   Use component instances when possible for consistency
7.   Handle errors appropriately as all commands can throw exceptions
8.   For large designs: 
    *   Use chunking parameters in `scan_text_nodes`
    *   Monitor progress through WebSocket updates
    *   Implement appropriate error handling

9.   For text operations: 
    *   Use batch operations when possible
    *   Consider structural relationships
    *   Verify changes with targeted exports

10.   For converting legacy annotations: 
    *   Scan text nodes to identify numbered markers and descriptions
    *   Use `scan_nodes_by_types` to find UI elements that annotations refer to
    *   Match markers with their target elements using path, name, or proximity
    *   Categorize annotations appropriately with `get_annotations`
    *   Create native annotations with `set_multiple_annotations` in batches
    *   Verify all annotations are properly linked to their targets
    *   Delete legacy annotation nodes after successful conversion

11.   Visualize prototype noodles as FigJam connectors:

*   Use `get_reactions` to extract prototype flows,
*   set a default connector with `set_default_connector`,
*   and generate connector lines with `create_connections` for clear visual flow mapping.
