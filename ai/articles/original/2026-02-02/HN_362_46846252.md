### Donate to the AGS Community

The AGS community is run by a team of dedicated volunteers, who put their time and efforts into keeping it running as a welcoming, friendly and informative place to be. The AGS server and forums are paid for out of our own pockets, so in effect it costs us money to provide a free service to AGS users.

If you appreciate the work we do, and would like to give a little something back, please use the below link to donate via PayPal. Any profit made after covering server costs will be put back into hosting community events such as [Mittens](http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/wiki/Mittens).
