# TEON: Tensorized Orthonormalization Beyond Layer-Wise Muon for Large Language Model Pre-Training

**来源**: [ArXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23286v1) | **作者**: 

## 摘要

Shared autonomy systems require principled methods for inferring user intent and determining appropriate assistance levels. This is a central challenge in human-robot interaction, where systems must be successful while being mindful of user agency. Previous approaches relied on static blending ratios or separated goal inference from assistance arbitration, leading to suboptimal performance in unstructured environments. We introduce BRACE (Bayesian Reinforcement Assistance with Context Encoding),...
